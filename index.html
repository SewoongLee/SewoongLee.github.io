                Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I have traced
                the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</p>

                    This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. In my experience, there is no such thing
                    as luck. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>

                <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Partially, but it also obeys your commands. The plans you
